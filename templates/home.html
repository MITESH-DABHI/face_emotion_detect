        Before we begin, make sure you are in a quiet spot with video and microphone on for this test. There is no
        need to worry - no one will ever see your actual video or voice. The information will be deleted after this
        session from our system. However, the analytics about your background, talents and emotional response to this
        short evaluation will be shared with our team for further follow-up.</h4>
